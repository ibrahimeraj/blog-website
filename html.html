      <h1>Welcome to Ecrivains.</h1>
      <h2>Who are we??</h2>
      <p>&emsp;We are a group of students who created this blogging website for writers who are pursuing or practicing the dream of writing without the fear of judgment or being trolled.<br>
    In this world of instagram likes and comments people usually lose their focus of things that really matter. A lot of judgement is passed is in this comments and likes some <br> hurtful some are not.
    Ecrivains provides us a space to write freely without fear of being judged on what you write or what your opinions say about you. Everyone who signs-up <br> gets a pen name of their choice thus maintaining anonimity.
    We also hope to see Ecrivains as an unbiased news sharing page not owned by an agency but by the people. You can openly <br>share opinions on matters without being subjected to people who have the opposite or different opinion.<br></p>
